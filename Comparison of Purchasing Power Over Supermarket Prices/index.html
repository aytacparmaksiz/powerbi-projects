I created a data set including European countries and Turkey in Power BI and to create a dashboard based on purchasing power.

I took the price data of various products on the market shelves and created a data set. This data set contains information about some European countries and Turkey.

I created an interactive dashboard consisting of the average monthly net salary of the countries and various statistical analyzes according to this salary.

The sources of the dataset are numbeo.com and globalproductprices.com. For consistency, I got all of the monthly net income information from Numbeo.

You can filter by country, product group and product, and evaluate purchasing power over supermarket prices and basket costs including all products.

The dashboard and the data created in Octobe and all currencies are expressed in Euro at the exchange rate of 05.10.2022.
